# easyparking:
With our idea, we would like to reflect the current parking situation in the city of Cologne selected by us (later then scalable to other cities) as far as possible in real time 
or at least with fairly current data and also make the currently free parking spaces visible for parking areas where the data allows this. 
The data we obtain is also made visible via a user interface.  


## explanation of our Folder-Solution and on what you see in our easyparking main branch:

We have set up the project in such a way that the various areas we have worked out together in the course of the project remain visible.
This is also because we can present 2 working UI solutions, which are ultimately based on the same data basis and agreements. 
In the individual folders of the team members there are also separate readme files that describe the respective code, so this file is only a first overview and explanation. 

## Folder "balapsub_code:
In the Folder "balapsub_code" you will find the code for our dataset with scraped data. We used some static and some dynamic data and used webscraping to get some more information from additional pages.

## Folder "hannah":
In the Folder "hannah" you will find the code for our dataset with 5 different datasets combined and our first UI solution using streamlit. You can also find some further information about the data we have used.

## Folder "thomas":
In the Folder "thomas" you will find our second UI solution using pyscript and folium. 
We came up with another solution because both of our solutions had different opportunities to make our scraped and formatted data visible and we had different expertises within our team.

## Folder "oliver":
In the Folder "oliver" you will find another approach to display the existing UI solutions, which however require a localhost, via tunneling via public URL.
In addition, the approach is designed to run completely without installing programs and purely via Google Colab.
This dataset is still "in progress" and not functional at this point, but it gives a preview of upcoming functionalities and can be a source of ideas for further implementations for other Techlabs participants.
