		-> the form 
			-> first option are the checkboxes for decision to find your parking places
			-> textfield start give option for your manual start address or over button "your address" find out gps data 
						-> this start getLocation() function in javascript
							-> XMLHttpRequest() -> find the address with the gps data over the url "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=json&q=" + position.coords.latitude + "," + position.coords.longitude
			-> second textfield are for target
		-> submit Button "Check Easy Parking"
			-> activate file fetch_geo_data.py with the get_geo() function
					-> read dataframe "parking_garage_infos.csv" for parking garage from webspace 
					-> fetch data target with pyfetch(url='https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=json&q=' + address, method="GET") 
						-> find geo coordinates target
					-> fetch data start with pyfetch(url='https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=json&q=' + address, method="GET") 
						-> find geo coordinates start
					-> read dataframe "merged_data.csv" for parking options from webspace
						-> merged_data from "merged_data.csv" with "parking_garage_infos.csv" with filter geo coordinates target
					-> folium.Map() collects the data from merged dataframe 
						-> pyscript.write('foliummap', m) give this information to index.html -> <div class="foliummap" id="foliummap"></div>
					-> show infos from "parking_garage_infos.csv" with css	-> pyscript.write('outputPG...', pg100) -> <div id="outputPG..."></div>
		-> show infos from "parking_garage_infos.csv" without css	-> pyscript.write('outputPG...', pg100) -> <div id="outputPG..."></div>
	-> parking_garage_infos.csv file is kept up to date by a task scheduler (only working if laptop is on) on laptop
		-> task scheduler start file save.py
			-> pandas, urllib.request, ftplib, numpy
				-> urllib.request open https://www.koeln.de/apps/parken/json/current and panda give it back as json file
					-> json becomes as csv file and ftplib transport it to webspace as parking_garage_infos.csv
